# This file is a table of identifiers for the various filament materials used in Stratasys FDM cartridges.
# Cartridges identify the material they contain by a hex material code.  For example, regular blue P400 ABS has
# a code of 0x05.  Note that some materials have been found to have more than one code (different formulations,
# possibly?) - for example, ABS_S has been found as both 0x0F and 0xA0.  To maintain a 1:1 relationship between
# material and code in this project, 0x0F has the identifier ABS_S, while 0xA0 is given the identifier ABS_S_2.
